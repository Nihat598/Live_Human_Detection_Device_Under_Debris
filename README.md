Post-disaster recovery operations require rescue teams to detect the presence and location of trapped victims inside buildings or under debris, which is of vital importance. For this purpose, various solutions are available, such as microwave radars, thermal detectors, and acoustic devices. Acoustic devices require a quiet environment and professional users. Thermal cameras, on the other hand, can lead to time loss for rescue teams as they detect many structures with temperature differences, such as plumbing inside buildings. Remote sensing with microwave radars stands out as a promising technology in search applications. Ultra-wideband (UWB) radars have become preferred options in recent years due to their high range resolution and good penetrability.

In this direction, we have developed the ARTER (Search and Detection Radar) system because UWB radars are the most suitable solution for this problem. Our innovative technology offers several advantages, including locating positions up to 3 meters under debris, detecting signs of life with heartbeats and breathing, displaying position and vitality information on the screen, and providing audio alarms. As a result, heavily damaged buildings can be checked for the presence of humans or pets before demolition, and post-disaster search and rescue operations can be conducted faster and more effectively. This technology enhances life-saving potential in wall surveillance and post-disaster rescue operations, while also offering advantages such as user-friendliness and cost-effectiveness. The developed algorithm and code is given as arter.py file.
We think of extending our work to being able to detect the alive in a distance much further than 3m. For, that we need monetary resources and required equipments. The used Antenna and Radar Module is given in files named as anten.png and radar.png, respectively.
